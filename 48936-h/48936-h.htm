<p class="in0" style="margin-bottom: 2em;"><i>by Major Charles D. Melson, U.S. Marine Corps (Ret)</i></p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">Operation</span> Watchtower
was the codename assigned
by the Joint
Chiefs of Staff for the
reduction of the Japanese
stronghold at Rabaul, on the
easternmost tip of New Britain Island
in the Bismarck Archipelago.
The plan called for the South Pacific
Area forces of Vice Admiral Robert
L. Ghormley (relieved in November
1942 by Vice Admiral William F.
Halsey) to move up the chain of the
Solomon Islands toward Rabaul,
beginning with the Guadalcanal
landings on 7 August 1942. In December
that year, patrol flights taking
off from Henderson Field on
Guadalcanal and from the decks of
U.S. fleet carriers in the waters
around the Solomon Islands discovered
the Japanese hard at work on a
well-camouflaged airfield at Munda
on the northern end of New Georgia.
This new field posed a definite
threat to the Allies still fighting to
wrest Guadalcanal from the enemy.
It had to be taken, or at the very
least, neutralized. U.S. pilots also
reported another field being completed
on Kolombangara across the
Kula Gulf from New Georgia.</p>

<p>In response to these potential
threats, Operation Toenails, landings
in the New Georgia Islands in
the Central Solomons with the capture
of Munda as the primary objective,
were planned, scheduled, and
mounted. The first step leading to
the invasion of New Georgia was
the occupation of the Russell Islands,
65 miles northwest of
Guadalcanal, which would serve as
a forward base on which airfields
would be constructed. Operation
Cleanslate on 21 February 1943 saw
the Marine 3d Raider Battalion
(Lieutenant Colonel Harry B. Liversedge)
land on Pavuvu, and the
43d Infantry Division (less a regimental
combat team) invade Banika.
Both landings were unopposed. The
11th Defense Battalion landed on
Banika the same day and had its
guns in place by noon. By 15 April,
Allied aircraft began operating from
the first of two new airstrips the
Seabees constructed on Banika.</p>

<p>The primary objective of Operation
Toenails was the capture of the
airfield on Munda in the New Georgia
group. Preliminary landings to
support the main effort were to be
made at Wickham Anchorage on
Vangunu Island, Viru Harbor, and
the Bairoko Harbor areas of New
Georgia. Rendova Island and
smaller islands nearby, across
Blanche Channel to the south of
New Georgia, were to be occupied
next and used as supply bases and
also as artillery positions for delivering
supporting fire for the main
attack on Munda. The plan called
for ground forces then to drive the
Japanese into the Munda Point
area and once they were there, Allied
air, artillery, and tanks could
support the main landing. The
enemy “would be annihilated or
forced into a costly withdrawal,”
according to the Allied concept of
the operation.</p>

<p>For Toenails, Rear Admiral Richmond
Kelly Turner, Amphibious
Force Commander, divided his assigned
forces into two task groups:
Western Force, which he would personally
command, was to seize Rendova,
Munda, and Bairoko. The
Eastern Force, under Rear Admiral
George H. Fort, also an experienced
amphibious force commander, was
directed to capture Wickham Anchorage,
Segi Point, and Viru Harbor.
Turner’s ground commander
was Army Major General John H.
Hester, who headed the New Georgia
Occupation Force (43d Infantry
Division; Marine 9th Defense Battalion;
the 136th Field Artillery Battalion
from the 37th Infantry Division;
the 24th Naval Construction
Battalion (Seabees); Company O of
the 4th Marine Raider Battalion; the
1st Commando, Fiji Guerrillas; and
assigned service troops). Fort’s
Eastern Force included Army
Colonel Daniel H. Hundley’s Army
103d Regimental Combat Team
(RCT), less a battalion with Hester;
Companies N, P, and Q of the 4th
Raider Battalion; elements of the
70th Coast Artillery (Antiaircraft)
Battalion; parts of the 20th Seabees;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>
and service units. Colonel Harry B.
Liversedge’s 1st Marine Raider
Regiment (less the 2d, 3d, and 4th
Battalions) was designated ready
reserve for the operation, while the
Army’s 37th Infantry Division (less
the 129th RCT and most of the
148th RCT) was held in general reserve
on Guadalcanal ready to
move on five days’ notice.</p>

<p>Hester’s corps headquarters was
formed by taking half of the 43d Division
staff, the rest remaining with
the Assistant Division Commander,
Brigadier General Leonard F. Wing,
USA. Over 30,000 men were in the
units assigned to the New Georgia
Occupation Force, the majority of
which were Army troops, Marine
and Seabee units, patrol-torpedo
(PT) boat squadrons, and naval
base personnel. Marines from the
10th and 11th Defense battalions
were in reserve as reinforcements.</p>

main attack on Munda, he had to commit

<p>Defending the New Georgia Island
Group were the <i>Southeast Detachment</i>
of Major General Noboru
Sasaki and the <i>8th Combined Special
Naval Landing Force</i> under Rear Admiral
Minoru Ota (later to die as
commander of Japanese naval
forces at Okinawa); subordinate
units included the <i>13th Infantry Regiment</i>,
<i>229th Infantry Regiment</i>, <i>Kure
6th Special Naval Landing Force</i>, and
the <i>Yokosuka 7th Special Naval Landing
Force</i>. New Georgia and Kolombangara,
and enemy outposts on
Rendova, Santa Isabel, Choiseul,
and Vella Lavella, were strongly defended.
The number of Japanese occupying
the outlying islands was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
comparatively small. The forces on
Kolombangara were “estimated” at
10,000 troops while those on New
Georgia were figured to be between
4,000 and 5,000.</p>

<p>1st and 2d Marine Aircraft Wing
squadrons based in the Russells
and Guadalcanal under the control
of Brigadier General Francis P.
Mulcahy’s 2d Marine Aircraft Wing
forward echelon staff would provide
air support for the operation.
The staging areas for the attack on
New Georgia were Guadalcanal
and the Russell Islands, where the
Marine 4th Base Depot, commanded
by Colonel George F.
Stockes, established a supply dump
for XIV Corps.</p>

<p>In mid-Spring 1943, reconnaissance
parties from the units slated
to take part in the New Georgia
campaign began patrolling in the
areas designated for landings.
Solomon Islanders acted as guides
and scouts led by British resident
administrators and Australian navy
intelligence personnel, who, as
Coastwatchers, hid in the hills in
the enemy rear areas. From here
they radioed information about
Japanese troop, air, and naval sightings
and movements to Allied listening
stations. With the exception
of two or three members from each
patrol party who remained behind
to arrange for guides and to give
homing signals to Allied vessels on
their approach, all patrols returned
to their parent units by 25 June
1943. For these individuals, the
campaign was already underway.</p>

<p>The Solomon Islands were some
of the least known and underdeveloped
areas in the world. John<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
Miller, Jr., himself a former Marine,
veteran of Guadalcanal, and after
the war an Army historian, considered
it “one of the worst possible
places” to fight a war. All the islands
had much in common, he
went on, and “much that is common
is unpleasant.” The islands
were mountainous, jungle covered,
pest-ridden, and possessed a hot-wet
tropical climate. There were no
roads, major ports, or developed
facilities. New Georgia was all of
this, and more.</p>

Kennedy. The Japanese were moving
into his base area where the Allies
planned to build an auxiliary
fighter strip. Responding to the request
for help, Turner loaded Lieutenant
Colonel Michael S. Currin’s
4th Raider Battalion on high speed
destroyer transports (APDs) and
sent it north to Segi Point. Captain
Malcolm N. McCarthy met the
raiders in a dugout canoe to guide
the ships in. McCarthy felt certain
that Company P’s commander, Captain
Anthony Walker, would have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
his men’s weapons at the ready, and
“I kept hollering, ‘Hold Your Fire!’”</p>

<p>Currin went ashore with part of
his headquarters and Companies O
and P, followed by Army and Navy
forces to begin the airstrip. After
linking up with Kennedy, Currin
turned his attention to his initial
goal, the seizure of the protected
anchorage at Viru Harbor. He had
to accomplish this prior to the arrival
of the invasion force on 30
June, and on the night of 27 June, he
and his Marines set out by rubber
boats across the mouths of the
Akuru and Choi rivers for Viru.</p>

<p>After an eight-mile paddle, the
raiders arrived at Regi Village early
on 28 June. Led by native guides,
Currin began the approach march
to Viru Harbor. Fighting a stubborn
combination of terrain, weather,
and Japanese patrols, the raiders
were short of their objective on 30
June. Meanwhile, the landing force
arrived on schedule and stood off
the beach after taking fire from
Japanese coastal defense guns.</p>

<p>The raiders launched their attack
at 0900, 1 July, to seize Tetemara
and Tombe Villages. Captain
Walker attacked Tombe with part of
his company, while the remainder
attacked Tetemara with First Lieutenant
Raymond L. Luckel’s Company
O. After six hours of fighting
and a Japanese counterattack, the
objectives were captured. Sergeant
Anthony P. Coulis’ Company P machine

water. The 4th Raider Battalion lost
13 killed and 15 wounded in this action.
The Japanese defenders withdrew,
with an estimated 61 dead
and 100 wounded. Currin turned
the beachhead over to the Army occupation
force and was taken back
on board ship and returned to
Guadalcanal. The remainder of the
4th Battalion headquarters and two
companies, led by battalion executive
officer Major James Clark, carried
out separate tasks in accordance
with plans to secure Wickham
Anchorage at Vangunu Island to
protect lines of communication
from the Russells and Guadalcanal
for the New Georgia operation. On
30 June, Captain Earle O. Snell, Jr.’s
Company N and Captain William
L. Flake’s Company Q supported
an Army landing force by going
ashore at Oloana Bay, where it
joined a scouting party and Coastwatchers
already there. Raider Irvin
L. Cross later wrote that he and the
other raiders disembarked from his
assault transport “in Higgins Boats
during a typhoon. In the dark it
was impossible to see the landing
craft from the deck.” Despite a confused
landing in poor conditions,
by afternoon the Marines and units
of the Army 2d Battalion, 103d Infantry
reached the Kaeruka River
and attacked the Japanese located
there. This position was taken and
then defended. A member of Company
Q, John McCormick, recalled
that the attack “was not very productive,”
but that a battle went on
all day with the Japanese, who had
gotten “quickly organized” and
fought back with their machine
guns and mortars. On 2 July, the
Japanese tried to land three barges
with supplies, but were met on the
beach and shot up. The raiders lost
14 killed and 26 wounded securing
Vangunu. The next raider deployment
was like those at Viru and
Vangunu, a supporting exercise to
back the main XIV Corps effort to
take Munda Point. Soon after the
Rendova landings, Colonel Liversedge’s
mission was changed
from being the landing force reserve
to being an assault force designated
the Northern Landing Group directed
to attack Japanese positions
on New Georgia’s northwest coast
at the Dragon’s Peninsula.</p>

<p>Three of the 1st Raider Regiment’s
four battalions had been
sent elsewhere. Liversedge’s landing
group consisted of the Marine raider
regimental headquarters, the 1st
Raider Battalion; the 3d Battalion,
145th Infantry; and the 3d Battalion,
148th Infantry. Because the operating
area was too far from the main landing
force for support, fire support
and supply came from the sea and
air. Communications were dependent
upon radio until a land-line
linkup could be made with the rest
of the occupation force to the south.</p>

<p>Liversedge was assigned several
tasks. First he was to land and
move against the Japanese forces at
Enogai Inlet and Bairoko Harbor.
Then he was to block the so-called
Bairoko Trail and disrupt Japanese
troop and supply movements between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
Bairoko Harbor and Munda.
The enemy, weather, and terrain together
conspired against this venture
from the beginning and the
raiders found themselves in a protracted
frontline fight rather than a
swift strike in the Japanese rear.
One of Liversedge’s battalion commanders,
Lieutenant Colonel
Samuel B. Griffith II, observed on
embarking at Guadalcanal that although
they shot off no fireworks
on Independence Day, “we consoled
ourselves with the knowledge
that there would be plenty of
those later.”</p>

<p><i>Soldiers and Marines consolidate their positions and construct barbed wire obstacles on

of the campaign.</i></p></div></div>

<p>On 5 July, the Northern Landing
Group landed at Rice Anchorage
east of Enogai and Bairoko. A narrow
beach, difficult landing conditions,
and concerns for an enemy
naval attack caused the destroyer-transport
force to depart, taking the
raiders’ long-range radio with it.
The landing from eight APDs and
destroyers (DDs) was unopposed
and met only by porters and scouts
(Corry’s Boys) under Australian
Flight Officer John A. Corrigan.
Griffith described them as small
men, “but their brown bodies were
wiry and their arm, leg and back
muscles were powerful. They wore
gaudy cheap cotton lap-lap, or
lavalavas.” These 150 New Georgians
were the Northern Landing
Group’s supply transport in a region
without roads.</p>

<p>Undeterred by the situation, Liversedge
moved out on jungle trails
in pouring rain to his first objectives,
leaving two Army companies
to secure the rear. In Griffith’s
words, they “alternately stumbled
up one side of a hill and slipped
and slid down the other.” The 1st
Raider Battalion pushed on to reach
the Giza Giza River by the night of
5 July with the larger and heavier
Army battalions following. Here
Liversedge split his force. The 3d
Battalion, 148th Infantry was sent
south to block the Bairoko Trail
and the remaining units went
north towards the Japanese on the
Dragons Peninsula. On the night of
6 July, the naval Battle of Kula Gulf
erupted with the resultant loss of
the cruiser USS <i>Helena</i> (CL 50).
This isolated the Northern Landing
Group from even naval support.
The villages of Maranusa I and
Triri were occupied and patrols
were soon in contact with the
enemy, members of the <i>6th Special
Naval Landing Force</i>, so-called
Japanese “marines.”</p>

<p>On 9 July, the Enogai defenses
were reached and, after an air
strike, Liversedge launched an immediate
attack with Lieutenant
Colonel Griffith’s 1st Raider Battalion.
Captain Thomas A. Mullahey’s
Company A was on the left, Captain
John P. Salmon’s Company C in
the center, Captain Edwin B.
Wheeler’s Company B on the right,
with Company D under Captain
Clay A. Boyd in reserve. Employing
machine guns and grenades, the
battalion advanced toward the
Japanese position until halted at
nightfall. The Japanese were well
dug-in and well armed with machine
guns and mortars, but their
heavy-caliber coast defense artillery
could only be used seaward. Supported
by 60mm mortars, the
raiders resumed the attack the
morning of 10 July, and took Enogai
Village. Richard C. Ackerman, a
Marine with Company C, remembered
“we soon came to a lagoon
which stopped our forward motion.
Our right flank, though, did overrun
the enemy’s warehouse and
food storage area.” The Japanese
lost 300 men at a cost of 47 Marines
killed, another 74 wounded, and 4
men missing. The battalion had
fought for 30 hours without rations
or water resupply. Army troops carried
up water and K-rations and
candy bars received in an air drop.
The elimination of the Japanese
coast defense artillery at Enogai allowed
American destroyers and
torpedo boats to operate unhampered
in the Kula Gulf, where they
disrupted Japanese barge traffic.</p>

<p>Under Japanese air attacks, the
1st Marine Raider Regiment consolidated
its gains and blocking positions,
while Colonel Liversedge
studied the Bairoko Harbor defenses.
Communications, resupply,
and fire support were problem
areas. The Japanese improved their
own dispositions and continued to
bring in troops and supplies from
Kolombangara by sea and then
moved them overland to Munda
Point. The main Japanese line was
on a ridge in front of the Americans.
The enemy fighting positions
were log and coral bunkers that
made excellent use of terrain and interlocking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
machine-gun fire supported
by heavy mortars. On the
night of 12&ndash;13 July, the Navy intercepted
a Japanese troop landing at
Kolombangara. Four days later, on
17 July, Liversedge pulled the 3d
Battalion, 148th Infantry back to Triri
Village for closer mutual support,
while other Army companies continued
to hold the Rice Anchorage area
and communications routes.</p>

<p>Reinforced on 18 July by the 4th
Raider Battalion, Liversedge planned
to attack Bairoko on 20 July 1943.
The attack was launched on schedule
despite the failure of a requested
airstrike to arrive. Liversedge
sent in Griffith’s battalion,
followed by Currin’s battalion, to
find an undefended flank or a
breakthrough point. Griffith committed
Wheeler’s Company B and
Company C under First Lieutenant
Frank A. Kemp. His other companies
had been used to bring these
two up to strength. Currin’s battalion
fielded four companies, but was
some 200 men understrength.
Companies B and C soon stalled on
the Japanese defenses. Captain
Walker took Company P forward
for support, while Snell’s Company
N tried to find an open flank along
the shoreline to the north. One of
Snell’s men, Frank Korowitz, remembered
feeling that he wanted to
get up and run when Japanese attacked
by surprise at close range,
but “I also felt that I would rather
be killed than have anyone know I
was scared.” Liversedge fed in his
remaining units to cover the gaps
that developed between the two
battalions and no longer had a reserve.
Walker recalled, “without
some kind of fire support (naval
gunfire or air) these raiders could
not penetrate the fortified enemy
line.” McCormick, with Company
Q, wrote that the Japanese had
plenty of time to prepare and had
“machine gun pits in the natural
shelter provided by the roots of
banyan trees and cut fire lanes
through the underbrush.” The combination
of machine guns, mortars,
and snipers guaranteed “almost instant
death” to any Marine caught
in these fields of fire.</p>

<p>At 1445, a Japanese mortar barrage
was followed with a counterattack
in the 1st Battalion area.
After this, another assault attempted
by the Marines of Company
Q lead by Captain Lincoln N.
Holdzkom bogged down within
sight of Bairoko Harbor. By now
there was a loss of almost 250
Marines, a 30 percent casualty rate.
The 1st Marine Raider Regiment
had 46 killed and another 200 or so
wounded, and about half the
wounded were litter cases. Liversedge
made no further headway
and withdrew that night to Enogai.
It required another 150 men to
move the casualties back and all
units were in defensive positions by
1400, 21 July.</p>

<p>By then, the effects of the fighting
and living conditions had taken a
toll in sickness and exhaustion of
the Northern Landing Group. Liversedge
was ordered to hold what
he had with available forces. Resupply
and casualty evacuation were
by air and there was no further reinforcement,
except a 50-man detachment
under Captain Joseph W.
Mehring, Jr., of the 11th Defense
Battalion that provided needed
40mm and .50-caliber antiaircraft
guns at Rice Anchorage.</p>

<p>Bairoko Harbor was attacked by
destroyers and torpedo boats, and
bombed by B-17 Flying Fortresses.
On 2 August, XIV Corps informed
Liversedge that Munda Point was
reached and his force should cut off
retreating Japanese near Zieta. On 9
August, the Northern Landing
Group linked up with elements of
the 25th Infantry Division advancing
from Munda Point and assumed
control of the 1st Marine Raider
Regiment. Scattered fighting continued
around Bairoko until 24 August
when it was occupied by the 3d Battalion,
145th Infantry. The Japanese
defenders, the <i>Special Naval Landing
Force</i> men, had pulled out by sea.
Occupying Corrigan’s “Christian
Rest and Recreation” camp of
thatched lean-to’s, the Marines totaled
their casualties for this effort;
regimental headquarters had 1
killed and 8 wounded, 1st Raider
Battalion lost 74 killed and 139
wounded, 4th Raider Battalion had
54 dead and 168 wounded; and all
suffered from the unhealthy conditions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>of the area. By 31 August 1943,
the 1st Marine Raider Regiment was
back on Guadalcanal for reorganization
scheduled in September, officially
noting the presence of “bunks,
movies, beer, chow.”</p>

uniform was being issued to the troops in the
field (although some camouflage clothing was
available) and to new Marines at the recruit depots.
These jackets and trousers were worn with field shoes,
leggings, and the M1 steel helmet. Individual combat
equipment was the distinctive Marine Corps 1941 pattern
that derived from earlier Army M1910 designs.
Basic components included the cartridge belt, belt suspenders,
haversack, and knapsack; supplemented by
poncho, shelter half, entrenching tool, gas mask, and
canteens. Lieutenant Colonel Samuel B. Griffith II, commanding
the 1st Raider Battalion, recalled that officers
and men landed with a basic allowance of ammunition, a
canteen of water, a battle dressing, and individual first aid
kit on the belt. In the pack were two days K-Rations, one
D-Bar (a highly enriched and very hard chocolate bar), tobacco,
a change of underwear, three pairs of socks, a poncho,
and a pair of tennis shoes. The pack roll was made
from a shelter half, blanket, and “one utility garment.” A
4th Raider Battalion Marine noted that at Vangunu they
“learned that one canteen of water was not enough. We
all had been issued a second canteen.”

Fighting Ninth</i></h2>

<p>Elements of four Marine defense
battalions played an important part
in the Central Solomons campaign.
Attached to the XIV Corps to support
of the attack on Munda Point
was the 9th Defense Battalion, commanded
by Lieutenant Colonel
William J. Scheyer. The battalion
was organized with an artillery
group (Batteries A and B), a heavy
antiaircraft group (Batteries C
through F), a light antiaircraft group
(Batteries G through I), and a headquarters
and service battery. The 9th
Defense Battalion’s participation in
the Guadalcanal campaign from December
1942 had provided it needed
experience, as the island was typical
of conditions to be found in the Central
Solomons. Some Marines from
the light antiaircraft group were
withdrawn from gun crews to train
with the battalion’s tank platoon for
tank-infantry operations. The greatest
challenge in preparing for the
campaign was Lieutenant Colonel
Archie E. O’Neil’s conversion of his
seacoast artillery into a field artillery
unit, at the same time absorbing 145
new men into the group. This was
accomplished in 22 days, a feat that
Admiral Halsey complimented.</p>

acquisition of 155mm guns as replacements
for the older M1918
French Grande Puissance Filloux
(GPF) guns. The battalion exchanged
90mm guns with the Army
70th Coast Artillery Battalion, giving
the antiaircraft group new guns.
High-speed and standard dual-mounts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
for 20mm guns were also
obtained. These were adapted by
the 9th from 37mm gun mounts,
giving the light antiaircraft group
greatly increased mobility by replacing
the stationary naval single-mounts.
The 9th Defense Battalion
obtained additional .30-caliber
heavy, water-cooled machine guns,
and trained the battalion band to
employ them with Headquarters
and Service Battery. The battalion
acquired three Landing Vehicle
Tracked Alligator amphibious tractors
for the operation, and then was
augmented by a whole amphibious
tractor platoon of nine vehicles
from the 3d Marine Division.</p>

muddy terrain beyond the beach.</i></p></div></div>

<p>On 27 June 1943, the battalion consisted
of a total of 1,459 officers and
men, reinforced with additional personnel
from the 3d Marine Division
and I Marine Amphibious Corps.
Most of these Marines had been on
Guadalcanal for seven months. At
one time or another, 40 percent of
them had malaria and the debilitating
effects of the tropics had been felt
by the entire unit. But the 9th was a
well-trained, experienced unit, outfitted
with the best equipment then
available to Marine defense battalions.
In the words of Lieutenant
Colonel Scheyer, “the prospect of
closing with the enemy was all that
was needed to supply morale.”</p>

<p>On 29 June, the 9th Defense Battalion
was attached to XIV Corps for
the duration of the New Georgia operation.
The battalion was given the
mission assisting in the capture, occupation,
and defense of Rendova
Island, by landing on the beaches
south of Renard Channel entrance.
Here it was to move immediately
into position to provide antiaircraft
defense. A third mission was to fire
155mm guns on the enemy installations,
bivouac areas, and the airfield
at Munda. As a fourth task, the tank
platoon would support the attack
on Munda Airfield. Fifth, the battalion
would be prepared to repel attack
by hostile surface vessels.
When the Japanese forces on New
Georgia Island were overrun, the
battalion would then move as a
whole or in part to Munda to defend
the field when Allied air units
moved in and began operating. All
these assigned tasks reflected the
battalion’s varied capabilities.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Colonel Scheyer said
on leaving Guadalcanal that the
Japanese “have a mistaken notion
that they must die for their Emperor
and our job is to help them
do that just as fast as we possibly
can.” At 1600 on 29 June, the 9th’s
first echelon, 28 officers and 641
enlisted Marines, combat loaded
on board the USS <i>Libra</i> (AK-53)
and USS <i>Algorab</i> (AK-25), the vessels
assigned to transport the battalion,
and sailed from Guadalcanal.
At Munda, a Japanese defender observed
that a “blue signal flare from
Rendova Point went up. I saw four
enemy warships ... this morning,
rain clouds hovered over us. At
Rendova, four cruisers, three destroyers,
eight transports and countless
numbers of boats appeared.”</p>

<p>At 0635 the morning of 30 June,
the first units of the XIV Corps’ assault
wave began landing on Kokorana
Island and East Beach of
Rendova. They were met by Coastwatcher
Flight Lieutenant D.&nbsp;C. Horton
and guides from the amphibious
reconnaissance patrols.</p>

<p>Both on Kokorana and on Rendova,
lead elements of the 9th found themselves
landing ahead of the assault
forces, meeting only light resistance.
The battalion band soon took out an
enemy machine gun position. Major
Robert C. Hiatt’s reconnaissance party
from the artillery group killed another
enemy soldier, who was said to have
been stripped of souvenirs before hitting
the ground. The defenders withdrew
inland to harass the Americans
from the hills and swamps.</p>

<p>Throughout the day, enemy air
attacks were turned back by
friendly fighters. Allied fighters
over the area on 30 June reportedly
destroyed over 100 enemy aircraft.
One attack by Japanese float planes
got through to strike at the naval
task force and damaged Admiral
Turner’s flagship, USS <i>McCawley</i>
(AP 10), so heavily that it had to be
sunk that night by a PT boat. At
1600, a lone Mitsubishi A6M Zeke
fighter strafed the beach without
causing any damage and was driven
off by defense battalion machine
gun fire, without causing
damage. Both the <i>Algorab</i> and <i>Libra</i>
were unloaded with the assistance
of the 24th Naval Construction Battalion.
The 24th, and other Seabee
units, supported the 9th in unloading
cargo and moving equipment
and contributed materially to the
general success of the battalion on
those first days and the battalion
was “in their debt.” On the first
day of landing, Battery E of the
Antiaircraft Group set up on Kokorana
and was prepared to fire by
1645; all Special Weapons Group
light antiaircraft guns landed and
were emplaced along the coast to
protect the XIV Corps’ beachhead;
sites were located for the 155mm
and the remaining 90mm batteries.
Battery demolition crews ventured
near and into enemy territory
to blast out fields of fire for
the gun positions.</p>

<p>Weather and terrain made unloading
and emplacement extremely difficult
for XIV Corps, the 43d Infantry
Division, and the 9th Defense Battalion.
Torrential rains began on 30 June
and continued almost without cessation,
rendering what passed for
roads impassable and causing great
congestion on the beaches as men
and supplies came ashore. Areas believed
suitable for occupation proved
to be swampy. Steel matting and corduroy
roads constructed with coconut
logs were utilized, but even
these were ineffective. Tanks, guns,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
and vehicles of all types mired down
in the incredible mud and only the
sturdiest tractors or manpower extricated
them. The congestion of supplies
on the beachhead rendered
them and the troops moving themselves
and the supplies inland vulnerable
to enemy air attack.</p>

<p>In many cases, 9th Defense Battalion
equipment had to be dismantled
and carried to assigned areas.
The 9th’s motor transport section
performed as best it could with the
resources available and until the
majority of its vehicles burned out
from the strain of operating in the
Rendova muck. Their task was
made easier by the amphibious
tractors, which were the only sure
means of transportation and these
had troubles of their own as they
threw off their tracks on uneven terrain.
“Frances,” “Tootsie,” and
“Gladys” were three amphibious
tractors in the beach area manned
by nine 3d Division Marines who
operated continuously keeping supplies
moving from position to position.
All tractors were damaged
eventually in the Japanese air attacks
that followed.</p>

<p>The 9th Defense Battalion’s second
echelon arrived on LSTs (Landing
Ships Tank) 395 and 354 and disembarked
at Rendova on 1 July as
Allied fighter cover continued to turn
back enemy air attacks. Joseph J. Pratl
with Battery A, which came in on
LST 354, wrote the ship was “big and
slow moving, loaded with ammunition
of every description.... Unloading
was done quickly, 155mm guns<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
and their tractors soon made mud
and made a slime which made
walking around difficult to say the
least.” By the end of the day, Captain
Henry H. Reichner’s Battery A
was in firing position. A third battalion
echelon arrived in LSTs 342
and 398 and disembarked on 2 July.
That morning Captain Walter C.
Well’s Battery B was emplaced and
Battery A commenced shelling
enemy positions in the Munda area.
On 3 July, both batteries of “Long
Toms” fired for effect on the Munda
airfield and enemy artillery positions
on Baanga Island. At Munda; a defender
wrote, “They must be firing
like the dickens. Sometimes they all
come at once. I don’t exactly appreciate
this shelling.”</p>

<p>The combat experience of the 9th
paid dividends, especially during
the first week ashore. The Marines
knew how to dig in for air attacks
and this saved lives. At 1335, 2 July,
18 Mitsubishi G4M Betty bombers
and Zeke fighter escorts entered the
area from the southwest and pattern-bombed
the beachhead, causing
considerable damage and
many casualties. Zero fighters flew
over the beach area at tree-top level,
strafing and bombing the beach and
landing craft. Gasoline storage tanks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
and an explosives dump were hit
and several fires were started in the
area. Battery A’s Pratl recounted,
“we saw the bombers, we assumed
them to be American B-25s. We hit
foxholes and the earth shook like a
rubber band as three bombs fell”
near his battery.</p>

Army and Navy units suffered

<p>Four 9th Defense Battalion men
were killed, one was missing, and
22 were wounded as a result of the
raid. Damage to the battalion included
two 155mm guns hit, two
40mm guns hit, three amphibious
tractors hit, one TD18 tractor demolished,
and an unknown amount
of supplies and personal gear destroyed.
One bomb landed between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
the trail legs of one 155mm gun in
Battery A, but failed to detonate.
This put the gun out of action until
the bomb was excavated, pulled
clear, and detonated. That day, the
battalion bomb disposal teams successfully
removed or destroyed a
total of 9 bombs and 65 unexploded
projectiles of 105mm or larger (Over
9,000 pieces of smaller enemy or
damaged friendly ordnance were
recovered by the end of the campaign
by these teams). Some light
antiaircraft guns fired at the raiding
planes, but downed none. The damage
caused by this attack was due
in part to the lack of working surveillance
radar, and friendly fighter
cover had been withdrawn because
of weather. The battalion’s SCR270
and 516 radars had not yet been installed
and the E Battery SCR268
radar had been fueled with diesel
from a drum marked “gasoline,”
putting it out of action at the time
of the attack.</p>

<p>Battalion S-4 Major Albert F.
Lucas was faced with the extremely
difficult task of supplying the
widely dispersed elements of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
battalion. Captain Lynn D. Ervin,
Battery G commander, remembered
that after he landed, working parties
from headquarters brought
around water and rations to the dispersed
firing batteries until they
had established their own field
kitchens. The preparation and delivery
of food required a major effort
throughout the campaign because
the battalion elements were
widely spread out in the target area
and the battalion had to feed all
other units which did not have their
own messing facilities. Hot meals
were provided once a day and the
artillery group’s pastry cook raised
morale by providing doughnuts
and other baked goods during
some of the more difficult periods.</p>

<p>At this same time, XIV Corps
began its Munda drive by moving
from Rendova to New Georgia,
supported by the Army 136th Field
Artillery Battalion and the 9th Defense
Battalion. Zanana Beach had
been selected for the 43d Infantry
Division’s landing. The division
order stated that the 43d, less the
103d Regimental Combat Team,
would “land on New Georgia Island,
capture or destroy all enemy
encountered, and secure the Munda
Airfield.” On 3 July, the 172d Infantry
moved by landing craft to
New Georgia, followed the next
day by the 169th Infantry. The
Munda drive had begun.</p>

<p>The 9th’s communications and
radar personnel carried on vital installation
work and respliced telephone
lines as soon as they were
damaged in the air raids. The air
control and reporting system of the
defense battalion and Commander
Aircraft New Georgia was installed
on 4 July when Condition Red was
sounded again. At 1430, the Japanese
attempted a repetition of the 2
July raid as 16 Betty bombers and
their fighter escort broke through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
the Allied combat air patrol overhead
and penetrated the area on the
same course followed before. Zeke
fighters roared in at tree-top level
strafing defenses. As the enemy
planes came in, several light antiaircraft
guns opened fire and a few
seconds later Captain Tracy’s E Battery
on Kokorana Island began firing.
Tracy recalled “bursts were
right on target, requiring no correction
... the flight entered a large
cloud. Pieces of planes were noted
falling out of the cloud.” This fire
caught the enemy by surprise and
of the 16 bombers only four got
their bombs away. Battery E had expended
88 rounds of ammunition
and a world’s record was established.
Twelve bombers and a
fighter were destroyed by the 9th’s
fire, the bombers and the Zeke
chalked up to Battery E and Special
Weapons Group respectively. That
day cheers were heard all over Rendova
“like a Babe Ruth homer in
Yankee Stadium.” Credit was given
the operators of the range section,
though Frank LaMountain said if he
had not kept the generator going
this would not have been the case.
The battalion had one officer killed
and three enlisted Marines wounded;
a heavy machine gun and the remote
control system of one 40mm
gun were destroyed.</p>

Rendova. The next day, a 90mm

light antiaircraft detachment arrived
from the 11th Defense Battalion.
The 90mm battery was staged
on Kokorana until the 9th Defense
Battalion displaced to New Georgia,
then it went into firing positions.
Light antiaircraft guns were positioned
on both Kokorana and Rendova.

<p>Captain Robert W. Blake’s platoon
of light tanks now played an
important part in the assault and
capture of Munda Airfield. The airfield
was defended by various aviation
personnel, antiaircraft units,
and the 229th Infantry Regiment.
During the next five days, 9th
Defense Battalion tanks spearheaded
the advance, knocking out
enemy log bunkers, pillboxes, and
other strong points. On a number of
occasions during the assault on the
enemy’s final defense positions
north of Ilanana, the tank platoon
operated in the densely wooded
and irregular terrain, under conditions
believed highly unsuitable
for tank employment. For the first
time, the Japanese attacked the
tanks with magnetic mines and
Molotov cocktails, bottles of gasoline
with lit wicks. On the morning
of 15 July, the tanks broke through
the enemy’s strong positions after
Army infantry had repeatedly been
thrown back. The XIV Corps attack
on Munda was stalled by both the
dogged resistance of the defenders
and the rugged terrain.</p>

<p>The “Murderers Row” of 155mm
guns continued shelling the Munda
Airfield, Baanga Island, and other
outlying islands throughout this
phase. The primary targets were
antiaircraft and field artillery positions,
and ammunition dumps.
Directed by both ground and air
observers, this firing proved very
effective. “The artillery shelling’s
accuracy has become a real thing.
We can never tell when we are to
die,” wrote a Munda defender. On
15 July, landing craft carried Battery
A to Tambusolo Island where it was
assigned the mission of covering
the western approach to Blanche
Channel with 155s against the incursion
of still dangerous Japanese
ships. On the night of 17 July at
Zanana, 9th Defense Battalion
Marines were involved in some
memorable fighting. A few days
earlier, Lieutenant Wismer led a patrol
which killed four members of
an enemy patrol and captured a
fifth, from whom they learned that
a Japanese force of 150 men was in
the vicinity. A rear command post
of the 43d Infantry Division with
approximately 125 troops, nearly all
specialists commanded by a legal
officer, was in the beachhead area.
The Marines under Wismer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
deployed for ground defense and Private
John Wantuck and Corporal
Maier J. Rothschild manned two
salvaged Army .30-caliber light machine
guns covering trails leading
to the perimeter of the Zanana area.
Colonel Satoshi Tomonari’s <i>13th Infantry
Regiment</i> attacked with several
groups during the night, forcing
Lieutenant Wismer’s defenders
back to their gun pits, while Wantuck
and Rothschild remained forward
of the lines engaging the
Japanese with machine-gun fire on
each assault. The Marines were attacked
by a regiment that had “the
determination of a suicide squad
and under the command of the Regimental
Commander they are determined
to fight to the last man.”</p>

<p>The following morning, Wantuck
was found dead from gunshot and
sword wounds. Rothschild was
wounded in a hand-to-hand encounter
with an enemy officer,
whom he killed. Wantuck and
Rothschild killed 18, wounded 12
to 15 others, and put a 90mm mortar
crew out of action. The senior
Army officer present, Major
Charles C. Cox, credited these two
Marines and timely artillery fire
with saving the division rear and
beachhead area. Rothschild and
Wantuck each received a Navy
Cross for their action. In all, Wismer’s
detachment had repulsed
four different columns, killing 18,
wounding others, and capturing a
prisoner. Over 100 Japanese bodies
were found later on the field by
Army units.</p>

<p>Pharmacist’s Mate First Class
Francis G. Peters was with the
Zanana detachment. While with the
unit, he performed as a one-man
clearing station for evacuating the
wounded, mainly Army personnel,
who were taken from the beach by
boat. He remembered the attack of
17 July because the Japanese “penetrated
as close as 25 yards and I
could see them shooting at our men
on the AA guns.” After the attack,
his work really began, tending to
the wounded, including a couple of
Japanese soldiers.</p>

<p>While the fighting for New Georgia
was ongoing, there were several
changes in the command structure of
the campaign. Major General Oscar
W. Griswold relieved General Hester
as commander of XIV Corps, and
Rear Admiral Theodore S. Wilkinson
relieved Admiral Turner as commander
of Task Force 31. The buildup of
forces on New Georgia continued
with the arrival of elements of Major
General J. Lawton Collins’ 25th Infantry
Division on 21 July and the arrival
the next day of the remainder of
the 37th Infantry Division. What one
division failed to accomplish would
now be attempted by two, the 43d
and the 37th.</p>

<p>After their initial daytime air
losses, the Japanese relied on air attacks
at night with only infrequent
daylight bombings. One was
mounted against the Rendova area
on 20 July by 6 planes, one on 1 August
by another 6 planes, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
another on 7 August by a formation of
15 aircraft. Nightly harassing raids
were made over the area by different
planes and pilots all dubbed
“Washing Machine Charlie.” Several
larger flights were turned back by
90mm fire. Marines of Battery F, the
searchlight battery, remained at their
posts despite Japanese strafing, and
radar men at their exposed, above
ground posts remained at their stations
throughout the raids, also. At
dawn, after one all-night raid, a Battery
C Marine was at the fuze pot
stark naked, “he hadn’t had time to
dress.” A total of 26 enemy planes
were downed by battalion antiaircraft
fire over Rendova.</p>

<p>On 26 July 1943, the 9th’s tanks,
reinforced by six others from the
10th Defense Battalion, led the assault
on enemy positions near Lambetti
Plantation. Tank operations
were conducted over difficult terrain
consisting of steep slopes,
heavy underbrush, and closely
spaced trees. The Japanese were in a
strongly fortified defensive position,
which consisted of a number of
heavy bunkers and pillboxes in a
clearing. In this action, which lasted
approximately five hours, one of the
tanks was disabled by a magnetic
mine, and two men were killed and
four wounded. A second assault on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
this position on 28 July by a battalion
of infantry and four Marine
tanks, was successful. Approximately

<p>Field artillery firing missions
against the New Georgia area continued
to be conducted by Battery B
until 3 August. The tank platoon of
the 10th Defense Battalion, reinforced
by five tanks from the 11th
Defense Battalion and the surviving
tank of the 9th Defense Battalion,
led the assault on Kokengolo and
Biblio Hills on 4 and 5 August.
After two days of heavy fighting,
they routed the defending forces.
The Marine tanks then cleared the
way to the principal objective of the
entire New Georgia campaign, the
Munda airfield, which was captured
and occupied by XIV Corps
Army troops on 5 August 1943.
Regiments of the 25th Infantry Division
pursued the Japanese as they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
withdrew north from Munda Point.
On the night of 6 August a naval
battle was fought in Vella Gulf,
where Japanese destroyers and
barges bringing in supplies and reinforcements
were turned back.</p>

<p>The battle for Munda airfield
over, the Zanana Beach and Laiana
Beach detachments moved on 6 August
to participate in the Munda defenses.
The detachments destroyed
12 enemy planes while at these locations.
A day later, the 9th Defense
Battalion began moving to the
Munda area. The moves were so organized
that there was no more
than a quarter of the battalion’s
weapons out of action at any one
time. The battalion was transported
largely by various types of
landing craft, which made the displacement
a slow, laborious process.
Captain Well’s Battery B of the
155mm Group moved to Kindu
Point on New Georgia on 8 August
and was assigned the mission with
its large guns of guarding the western
approaches to Blanche Channel.
On landing, Battery B and an Army
antitank platoon cleared the area of
remaining Japanese stragglers.</p>

<p>At Munda Airfield, immediately
after the area was cleared of Japanese,
construction units moved in to
repair and enlarge the “emergency”
field built by the enemy. By the
evening of 13 August, this work
had progressed sufficiently to permit
four Army Curtiss P-40
Warhawks to make an unscheduled
landing and to “christen” the field
with a brief fly-over. This was soon
followed by the arrival of Marine
air units, including VMF-123 and
-124. Other Marine squadrons soon
arrived, including the VMF-214
“Black Sheep” of Major Gregory
Boyington, who became a grudging
admirer of the 9th’s antiaircraft
marksmanship and a source of entertainment
with his radio transmissions
while flying over Munda.</p>

<p>Instead of attacking the main
Japanese force on Kolombangara at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
Vila, the American force isolated
the enemy by landings on nearby
Vella Lavella on 15 August. Admiral
Halsey did not want another
slugging match like Munda. A
landing force was built around the
uncommitted Army 35th Regimental
Combat Team, commanded by
the 25th Infantry Division’s assistant
commander, Brigadier General
Robert B. McLure, and supported
by the Marine 4th Defense Battalion.
The Japanese resisted in the air
and sea, but enemy ground forces
were too busy withdrawing to put
up a determined resistance. The 4th
Defense Battalion, led by Lieutenant
Colonel Harold S. Fassett,
defended the beachhead against 121
attacks and downed 42 Japanese
planes. The Allied occupation of
these positions and pressure from
Arundel and New Georgia put Vila
on Kolombangara in a precarious
position. In many ways, this was a
prelude to the Marine Bougainville
campaign as it brought I Marine
Amphibious Corps and new units
not involved in the fighting into the
New Georgia area. American
fighter cover came from the Munda
and Segi Airfields.</p>

<p>By 15 August, the 9th Defense
Battalion was set up and emplaced
in new dispersed positions. Three
days later, another major naval surface
action occurred off Vella
Lavella as the U.S. Navy combatants
intercepted destroyers and barges
attempting to evacuate Japanese
troops. From 16 through 19 August,
Japanese artillery on Baanga Island
shelled Munda Airfield and Kindu
Point causing several casualties and
some minor damage. Friendly aircraft
and artillery operated against
these elusive cannon and finally silenced
them. The battalion suffered
no casualties from this shelling,
though one gun crew’s tent was demolished
by a direct hit and there
were several hits on other positions.
The 9th’s antiaircraft guns were
now fully placed to protect the airfield.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
Enemy air attacks on the
Munda area, carried out at night or

<p>The artillery group used the services
of spotter aircraft, but because
of enemy gunfire, switched from
the light observation planes to
Grumman TBFs because their
armor plating gave the pilots
greater protection. First Lieutenant
Donald V. Sandager and Sergeant
Herschel J. Cooper flew these missions
over Kolombangara. “We both
volunteered to a request from Major
Hiatt. When we reported to Munda
Airfield we had no parachutes and
were told each flier had to have his
own,” recalled Sandager. “The pilots
were inexperienced and flew
up from Guadalcanal each morning
and we had to direct them to
find the battery and Kolombangara.
Radio communication with
the battery was bad.” Admiral
Halsey noted the artillery group
and Lieutenant Colonel O’Neil’s
ability to “utilize air spotting and
the accuracy of their fire which
stood out above other more experienced
groups.”</p>

<p>The peak of enemy air activity
over Munda Airfield occurred the
night of 14&ndash;15 September when
enemy planes kept gun crews at
battle stations all night. The 90mm
group expended 3,378 rounds,
downing one plane and causing
most of the enemy planes to jettison
their bombs over the jungle or the
sea. At Vila, a Japanese commander
reported, “it had become very difficult
to fire the antiaircraft guns as
the enemy places their artillery
upon our position immediately
after we commence firing upon the
aircraft.” At Piru, Japanese counterbattery
fire hit the artillery group
throughout September and the first
two days of October. A number of
the enemy artillery projectiles failed
to detonate and there were no casualties
from the shelling.</p>

<p>On 15 September, General Sasaki
was ordered to evacuate his remaining
12,400 men from Kolombangara.
The next month on 3 October, while
flying his assigned air spotter missions,
Lieutenant Sandager reported
Vila evacuated; the Japanese had
pulled out. Lieutenant Colonel
Scheyer was pleased to state that for
the “first time in this war the enemy
had been driven from his base by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
bombing and artillery fire.” He
concluded that at Kiska it was
bombing and ship’s gunfire, at
Kolombangara it was naval gunfire,
bombing, and artillery fire that
turned the tide. The final action of
the campaign was a sea battle on
6&ndash;7 October when U.S. Navy destroyers
intercepted Japanese evacuation
ships during the Battle of
Vella Lavella.</p>

1943. While at Munda Airfield, the
9th Defense Battalion accounted for
eight more enemy planes. Numerous
alerts, conditions red, and general
quarters stand-tos that began
an hour before dawn and an hour
after sunset, had occurred daily for
all gun crews. In early November,
Battery A moved to Nusalavata Island
and Battery B to Roviana Island
where the 155mm guns covered
Munda Bar and the eastern
approach to Blanche Channel respectively.
Lieutenant Colonel
Scheyer remained in command of
the 9th until 3 November, when he
was assigned to I Marine Amphibious
Corps and the command was
turned over to Lieutenant Colonel
Archie E. O’Neil.</p>

<p>On 22 November, the 9th Defense
Battalion was attached to VI
Corps Island Command for occupation
duties. On 31 December, the
battalion, with the exception of
one radar crew and two searchlight
sections, was relieved of the
Munda Airfield defenses by the
Army 77th AAA Group. The 9th
Defense Battalion spent several
weeks in camp in the Munda area
waiting for transportation. These
weeks were not idle as central
camps for the several groups had
to be set up and improved. Training
schedules, begun in the later
stages of the campaign, were carried
out. Transport ships were
available for the trip to the Russell
Islands beginning on 13 January
1944 and continued until the entire
battalion move was completed
on 25 February.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
The fighting by the 9th Defense
Battalion contributed considerably
to the victory of the land forces on
New Georgia, and demonstrated
the value of advance base defense.
The 9th was in action against
Japanese aircraft on 59 different
days, for a total of 159 fire missions
and 249 alerts, with 46 enemy
planes downed. Not counted in
these statistics were aircraft damaged
or diverted from their intended
targets and forced to undertake
less accurate nighttime
bombing missions. The fire of
155mm guns destroyed a number
of enemy artillery positions and
troops on Munda, Baanga, and
Kolombangara. Numerous pillboxes
and machine gun positions
were destroyed and enemy troops
killed by the tank platoon on New
Georgia Island. Although the firing
batteries and tanks were the most
active elements of the battalion,
other components of the battalion
were deeply involved in the fighting
also. The battalion also destroyed
a machine gun position
and killed three Japanese on Rendova
and killed another 22 enemy
and captured two prisoners at
Zanana.</p>

<p>Battalion losses throughout the
campaign were remarkably few: 13
dead, 1 missing, over 50 wounded
in action, and other non-battle casualties.
Malaria caused a number of
the Marines to be evacuated. General
Griswold summarized the battalion’s
performance by concluding
that every “officer and man of the
organization has reason to feel
proud of its accomplishment.” The I
Marine Amphibious Corps commander,
Lieutenant General
Alexander A. Vandegrift, said “how
proud I am to belong to the same
outfit as they do.”</p>

first time in the Central Solomons, where it earned its nickname
because of a camouflage paint scheme. There were
1,052 LSTs built during World War II for the U.S. Navy, with
minor differences between the various classes. The LSTs had
elevators and deck ramps to connect the main deck and
tank deck, providing for smaller landing craft to be transported
on the main deck, and a conning tower added over
the pilot house. They were armed with 40mm and 20mm
antiaircraft guns in twin and single mounts. The LSTs displaced
1,653 tons, with a length of 328 feet, a beam of 50
feet, and were driven by General Motor diesels.</p>

naval ordnance designed for shipboard mounting
and modified for use ashore, often requiring extensive
engineering and manhandling to emplace in static
positions. The war soon required the ordnance to be
mobile, which was accomplished by adapting Army
ordnance material. Obtained first were the standard
M1918 GPF 155mm guns. These were followed by the
M1A1 155mm gun employed by defense and corps artillery
battalions throughout the war. This piece
weighed 30,600 pounds, had a split trail and eight pneumatic
tires, was moved by a tractor, and was served by a
combined crew of 15 men. It could be pedestal mounted
on the so-called “Panama Mount” for its coast-defense
mission. It remained in the Marine Corps inventory long
after World War II.</p>

Solomons was provided by U.S. Navy medical
officers and corpsman assigned to these
units. Combat casualties were not the only medical
concern because of the primitive conditions that existed
during the campaign. The 9th Defense Battalion
lost an average of 2.42 men a day, or 65.17 a month, to
causes other than combat injuries. The 1st Marine
Raider Regiment found itself on 11 August 1943, with
436 men of its 956 Marines fit for duty. Other than
those wounded in action, it became necessary to evacuate
malaria cases also. Getting casualties to the beach
or airfield through the jungle or over the muddy roads
and trails was extremely difficult. After the landings
on New Georgia, only the most serious malarial cases
were evacuated. Much of the recurring malaria was
undoubtedly brought on by the combination of hard
work under combat conditions, lack of sleep, and
inadequate diet. Besides malaria, there was a considerable
amount of dysentery, diarrhea, minor fevers,
fungus infections, and boils. There were even a few
cases of psychoneurosis or “combat fatigue.”</p>

<h2><a name="Milk_Runs_and_Black_Sheep" id="Milk_Runs_and_Black_Sheep"></a><i>Milk Runs and Black Sheep</i></h2>

<p>The first Marines to fight at
New Georgia were the aircrews
who were sent to blunt Japanese
efforts to establish an airfield at
Munda Point in December 1942.
Thus began a routine air and sea
pounding of the Munda Airfield
until ground forces could capture
it for Allied use.</p>

<p>For Marine flyers, these missions
evoked “a parade of impressions&mdash;long
over-water flights; jungle hills
slipping by below; the sight of the
target&mdash;airfield, ship, or town, sometimes
all three; the attack and the violent
defense; and then the seemingly
longer, weary return....” The role
of land-based aviation in the Central
Solomons Campaign was critical, because
the Japanese air effort had to
be neutralized before Allied air and
ground forces could climb up the
Solomons ladder towards Rabaul.
Unless the Allies could capture suitable
airfields closer to the Japanese
base areas at Rabaul and Bougainville,
the air war would be limited in
range and effect. The Guadalcanal
airfields were 650 miles from Rabaul,
Munda Point was a somewhat-closer
440 miles. For Marines aviators,
Munda was a rung on the ladder that
ended at Rabaul.</p>

<p>The air war for the Central
Solomons was a series of sorties&mdash;fighter
sweeps and bombing runs.
For aviation units, the operating
area was divided into the combat
area, the forward area, and the rear
area. These zones shifted as the
campaigns moved north towards
the Rabaul area. While the 1st and
2d Marine Aircraft Wings were present
in the Southern Pacific,
Marines flew under a joint air command,
Commander Aircraft
Solomons (ComAirSols). Rear Admiral
Marc A. Mitscher’s ComAirSols
was comprised of three subordinate
segments: Bomber, Fighter,
and Strike Commands. Strike Command
was led by Colonel Christian
F. Schilt, who had been awarded a
Medal of Honor for heroism in
Nicaragua in 1928, and Fighter
Command was under Colonel Edward
L. Pugh; both veteran Marine
aviators in a structure where experience,
“not rank, seniority, or service,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
was paramount. The Marine
squadrons flew Grumman F4F
Wildcats, Grumman F6F Hellcats,
and Chance-Vought F4U Corsairs in
Fighter Command; and Grumman
or General Motors TBF Avenger torpedo
bombers and Douglas SBD
Dauntless dive bombers in Strike
Command. Also operating in the
theater was Marine Aircraft Group
25, the South Pacific Combat Air
Transport Command (SCAT), which
flew unarmed transport planes,
Douglas R4D Skytrains, bringing in
supplies and replacements and
evacuating wounded without
fighter escorts such as the bombing
missions had. Some 40 other
squadrons were in rearward bases,
making a total of 669 aircraft available
for the Central Solomons campaign.
They were opposed in the air
by the Japanese <i>Eleventh Air Fleet</i>
and Japanese Army air units defending
New Guinea.</p>

<p>The Corsair, known as the
“Whistling Death” to the Japanese
and the “Bent Wing Widow Maker”
to the Marines, was delivered in
March 1943 in time to have eight
Marine squadrons available for the
New Georgia campaign. The Corsair,
along with the new F6F Hellcat
fighter, dominated the air-to-air
battle to sweep the skies of the Japanese.
This superiority was enhanced
by Army Air Corps aircraft, the Lockheed
P-38 Lightning, for example.
Once introduced, each new aircraft
version could do a little more than
the basic models; it could fly higher,
fly longer, and carry more armament
than its predecessor. Advances in
radio detection and ranging (radar)
and communications continued as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
well to ensure the control systems
kept pace with the aircraft.</p>

<p>One Marine with Fighter Command,
Major John P. Condon, recalled
that ComAirSols routinely
struck the airfields of southern
Bougainville “with escorted bombers,
night attacks by Navy and Marine
Corps TBFs, and some mining at
night of the harbors.” He went on
to observe that the shorter-range
SBDs were “invariably escorted in
their routine reduction efforts
against the fields in New Georgia.”
Routine did not mean safe, as the
Japanese just as routinely made
their fighter presence known. Naval
officer and novelist James A. Michener
heard a pilot observe that he
was “damned glad to be the guy
that draws the milk runs.” But, “if
you get bumped off on one of them,
why you’re just as dead as if you
were over Tokyo in a kite.”</p>

<p>One incident occurred that symbolized
the joint nature of the air effort,
the destruction of the aircraft
transporting Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto,
who had planned the attack
on Pearl Harbor. Allied intelligence
agencies learned that the
admiral and his staff would fly to
Kahili on 18 April 1943. Admiral
Mitscher ordered Fighter Command
to intercept Yamamoto’s aircraft.
Planning for this mission fell
to the Fighter Command’s deputy,
Lieutenant Colonel Luther S.
Moore, who scheduled Army long-range
P-38 Lightnings fitted with
Navy navigational equipment for
the task. The flight plan was prepared
by the command operations
officer, Major Condon. Yamamoto’s
plane was intercepted and shot
down, ending the life of one of
Japan’s major combat leaders.</p>

<p>At the end of April 1943, the
Japanese <i>Eleventh Air Fleet</i> launched
a series of determined, but unsuccessful,
attacks to disrupt the Allied
buildup on Guadalcanal and in the
Russell Islands. These continued
through the month, and on 16 June,
ComAirSols planes intercepted and
virtually destroyed 100 Japanese
aircraft before they reached their
target, the New Georgia invasion
fleet. By the end of the month, the
Allied forces were landing on New
Georgia and the Japanese lost the
battle to disrupt the offensive. The
Japanese responded with repeated
raids against shipping and landing
areas, but the balance of air power
was decidedly with Commander
Aircraft Solomons. A Marine airman
wrote that the Japanese were
creating an ever-growing number of
Marine, Army, and Navy fighter
aces in the process.</p>

<div id="ip_31" class="figcenter" style="width: 592px;">
  <div class="captionl top"><p><i>The first Marines to fight in the Central Solomons campaign were

</div>

<p>By June, Marine Aircraft Group
(MAG) 21 was pounding away at
Munda, but not without losses. Flying
from Guadalcanal and Russell
Islands, ComAirSols fighter and
strike aircraft covered the Toenails
landings and subsequent operations
ashore. From 30 June 1943 through
July, there were only two days that
did not have “Condition Red” and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
dogfights with Japanese aircraft
over the objective area by Allied
combat air patrols. At the same
time, Japanese naval forces were located
and attacked, thus forcing the
Japanese to move at night by circuitous
routes with landing barges
alone. Bomber and Strike Command
aircraft ranged as far north as
Ballale, Buin, Kahili, and the Shortlands
in concert with Fifth Air Force
strikes at the same locations.</p>

<p>Despite this pressure, the Japanese
continued to attack Allied forces
from the air. ComAirSols planes
were not able to operate effectively
at night within range of Allied antiaircraft
artillery that could not tell
friendly from enemy aircraft. Another
obstacle to total Allied success
was the dense jungle-covered terrain
that hindered identification targets
and accurate assessment of the
results of air strikes.</p>

<p>For efficient air control for the
New Georgia operation, Admiral
Mitscher set up a new command,
Commander Aircraft New Georgia
(ComAir New Georgia), as part of
the landing force and under Marine
Brigadier General Francis P. Mulcahy,
who commanded the 2d Marine
Aircraft Wing. ComAir New
Georgia had no aircraft of his own,
but controlled everything in the air
above or launched from a New
Georgia airfield. Mulcahy and his
staff ensured command, control,
and coordination of direct support
air for the New Georgia Occupation
Force after it had landed.</p>

<p>ComAir New Georgia established
its command on Rendova after the
assault waves landed on D-Day, 30
June 1943. From Rendova, he began
to integrate the air defense and support
system to provide XIV Corps
with direct air support. On 11 July,
Commander Aircraft Segi under
Lieutenant Colonel Perry O.
Parmelee was established under
Mulcahy’s direct command. The
ground forces were ashore on New
Georgia and pushed ahead at
Zanana and Laiana and were poised
at the edge of Munda Airfield at the
end of July. Mulcahy provided air
support to the infantry advance at
Munda Point and against other
Japanese-held areas on New Georgia.
By the end of the campaign,
Mulcahy had ordered over 1,800
preplanned sorties mainly flown by
SBDs and TBFs against targets at
Viru, Wickham, Munda, Enogai,
and Bairoko.</p>

<p>In addition, there were some 44
close air support strikes using ad
hoc forward air control and tactical
air control parties from Mulcahy’s
command. This was a significant
step in the evolution of the air control
system that eventually formed
the air-ground team for the
Marines. Close air support missions
were planned in detail the
day prior to execution. The requested
missions went to Mulcahy
and, if he approved, they then
were forwarded to Guadalcanal,
the Russells, or Segi Point for
scheduling. The next day these aircraft
reported to a rendezvous
point and contacted an air support
party on the ground which used
radio, lights, smoke, or air panels to
direct the strike. General Mulcahy
commented that the use of aircraft
close to the frontlines “proved to be
impractical” with accuracy.</p>

<p>The R4D Skytrains of MAG-25 delivered
100,000 pounds of food,
water, ammunition, and medicine
that was the Northern Landing
Group’s only source of supply at
times. This support prompted one
Marine raider to ask that the air drop
containers be combat, or spread,
loaded as on one occasion they recovered
19 of a 20-container load
drop and “only later discovered the
missing drop contained medicinal
brandy.” Air drops of supplies went
to the other ground forces as well,
throughout a campaign fought in
difficult, trackless, terrain.</p>

<p>On 25 July, a massive strike consisting
of 66 B-17 and B-24 bombers
in concert with naval gunfire ships
struck at Lambetti Plantation, followed
by an 84-plane strike on antiaircraft
artillery positions at Biblio
Hill. This was coordinated with the
final drive to take the campaign’s
main objective, Munda airstrip. The
Japanese continued to delay the 43d
Infantry Division and another strike
followed on 1 August by a 36-plane
attack of SBDs and TBFs, protected
by some 30 fighters.</p>

<p>After the capture of Munda
Point, General Mulcahy moved his
command from Rendova to Munda
airfield to set up strike and fighter
control at Kokengolo Hill. In a
Japanese-built tunnel that Navy
Seabees had cleared of debris and
dead, Mulcahy was able to conduct
round-the-clock operations. The
first fighters assigned to Munda
landed at 1500 on 14 August.
While safe, the Seabee-cleared shelter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
was also hot and smelled of its
former dead occupants. On 15 August,
Mulcahy sent VMF-123 and
-124 fighters from Munda and Segi
fields to cover the Vella Lavella
landings, during which they
claimed 26 Japanese aircraft
downed. On this day, VMF-124’s
First Lieutenant Kenneth A. Walsh
began a streak that would eventually
earn him the Medal of Honor
for shooting down 21 Japanese aircraft.
After accounting for three
aircraft over Vella Lavella, he
brought his Corsair back to Munda
Field with 20mm holes in the
wings, several hydraulic lines cut,
a holed vertical stabilizer, and a
flat tire.</p>

<p>From 16 through 19 August
1943, the Japanese shelled the airfield
in the day and bombed it at
night. The artillery threat was
eliminated with the capture of
Baanga Island, but the air raids
continued with intermittent bombing
and strafing through the fall.
From then, until the establishment
of airfields on Bougainville three
months later, Munda Field was the
scene of intense activity as planes
landed and took off to strike at
Rabaul and Japanese shipping
which were first trying to supply,
and then evacuate, ground forces.
Many barges were destroyed in
the withdrawal that took some
9,400 Japanese off Kolombangara.
Admiral Halsey believed that
3,000 to 4,000 other Japanese were
killed during these evacuations.</p>

<p>Captain John M. Foster, an F4U
pilot, wrote about flying during this
time and his first mission from
Munda. “Never had I attempted to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
land a plane on a field as narrow
and short as the Munda strip,” he
recalled. Rolling onto the taxiway,
he was thankful for the 2,000 horsepower
of engine to “plow through
the mud.” The crews lived in tents
and messed in a screened framed
building chow-hall which the
Seabees built. The air units provided
dawn to dusk coverage, with the
night spent in rest and recovery. The
night’s sleep was often disrupted by
the appearance of a single Japanese
bomber variously called “Washing
Machine Charlie,” “Louie the
Louse,” “Maytag Charlie,” or “other
names less printable.”</p>

<p>On 24 August, ComAir New
Georgia at Munda was relieved
by Commander Aircraft Solomon’s
Fighter Command, at which time,
General Mulcahy turned over his
responsibilities to Colonel William
O. Brice. Mulcahy’s staff continued
to coordinate liaison and spotter
aircraft and strike missions launching
from Munda Field until relieved
of these responsibilities by
ComAirSols on 24 September.</p>

<p>“Success in the air is a lot of little
things,” observed VMF-214’s commander
and Medal of Honor recipient,
Major Gregory (Pappy) Boyington,
and most of them “can be taken
care of before takeoff.” With the
Japanese air bases now within closer
range of Allied aircraft, Boyington
and others conducted fighter sweeps
of 36 to 48 planes that were classics
of their kind. Throughout this, escorted
bomber and strafing attacks
continued. The capture and use of
Munda Field was now felt by the
Japanese “in spades” observed
Fighter Command’s Condon, as dive
bombing and strafing attacks against
the enemy were daily routine.</p>

<p>On 28 August, First Lieutenant
Alvin J. Jensen of VMF-214 was lost
in a rainstorm over Kahili and
when he broke through the clouds
he found himself inverted over the
Japanese field. Turning wings level,
he proceeded to shoot up the flight-line
and accounted for 24 enemy
aircraft on the ground. Photographs
confirmed the damage and Jensen
earned the Navy Cross for this
work, described as “one of the
greatest single-handed feats” of the
Pacific War.</p>

<p>During this time, Lieutenant
Colonel Frank H. Schwable’s
VMF(N)-531 arrived in the Russells
to begin night-fighter operations
along with a similar Navy unit.
Using ground-controlled radar intercept
vectors, the squadron’s
Lockheed PV-1 Venturas then
closed for the kill using the aircraft’s
on-board radar. This began
the Marines’ ability to deny the
Japanese the cover of darkness over
Vella Lavella and elsewhere.</p>

<p>Air support during the Central
Solomons campaign was considered
of high quality by all commanders.
Aviation historian and veteran Pacific
War correspondent Robert
Sherrod estimated that of the 358
aircraft the Japanese lost during this
campaign, 187 were destroyed by
Marine air. More significant were
the resultant deaths of highly
trained and experienced pilots and
crews whom the Japanese could not
replace. Marine aviation unit casualties<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
for operations in the Central
Solomons were 34 of the 97 Allied
aircraft lost. As a postscript to New
Georgia operations, on 20 October
1943, Commander Aircraft Solomons
moved to Munda to use the
airfield as his headquarters from
which he would fight the New
Britain and Bougainville campaigns.</p>

<p class="drop-cap b"><span class="smcap1">Not</span> all aircraft in the Central Solomons were fighters
or bombers. The Douglas DC-3 Skytrain or Dakota
(C-47 in the Navy version) was designed in 1933,
and became the standard American transport of the war.
The plane was an all-metal monoplane with twin engines
and retractable landing gear. It was powered by two Pratt &amp;
Whitney radial engines of 1,200 horsepower each. It carried
a crew of three, 28 passengers or 18 stretchers, and three
medical attendants. It could also carry up to 6,000 pounds
of cargo at average speeds of 185 miles-per-hour. The U.S.
Navy and Marines had some 600 Skytrains, designated as
R4Ds. In the Central Solomons they were used for air resupply
and medical evacuation. The Marines were still
using the C117, a variation of the R4D into the 1970’s.

<h2><a name="A_Joint_Pattern_for_Victory" id="A_Joint_Pattern_for_Victory"></a><i>A Joint Pattern for Victory</i></h2>

<p>The last Japanese air attacks on
New Georgia came the nights of 16
and 17 January 1944, but by then
the campaign was finished and the
final score taken. Army historian
John Miller quoted a senior officer
as concluding that the heavily outnumbered
Japanese stood off nearly
four Allied divisions in the course
of the action, and successfully withdrew
to fight again. One Japanese
noted at the time that the:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>... Japanese Army is still
depending on the hand-to-hand
fighting of the Meiji Era
while the enemy is using
highly developed scientific
weapons. Thinking it over,
however, this poorly armed
force of ours has not been
overcome and we are still
guarding this island.</p></blockquote>

<p>In his postwar memoirs, Admiral
Halsey commented on how the
smell of burnt reputations in the
New Georgia campaign still filled
his nostrils. The smoking reputations
Halsey referred to came as
the result of outright reliefs and
transfers of senior officers and they
were not limited to any one service.
Numerous changes were
made in the command structure
until he got the commanders
needed to produce results. The
payoff to the New Georgia operation
resulted in the Vella Lavella
landings that bypassed Kolombangara
and successful Bougainville
and New Britain campaigns that
demonstrated the pattern for successful
joint operations there and
throughout the Pacific War.</p>

<p>The Army had 1,094 men killed
and 3,873 wounded in the fighting
for New Georgia, while the Marines
suffered 650 casualties in all. The
Marines came through in better condition
than might have been otherwise
expected. Morale during the periods
of greatest danger had been
high. In the last two months of the
campaign with enemy activity virtually
nonexistent, the effects of the
rough conditions showed to a certain
extent, but at no time, was there any
slackening in the performance of
duty. For most of the campaign, shelter
and sanitation were absent and
the food, though usually of sufficient
quantity, was seldom appetizing.</p>

<p>It was felt after the Solomons campaign
that “struggle for control of the
Solomon Islands was a critical turning
point in the war against Japan.
These campaigns can best be appreciated
as a sequence of interacting
naval, land, and air operations.” The
contribution to the ability to conduct
joint operations was measured in the
differences between the fighting on
New Georgia in the summer 1943
and the success realized at
Bougainville and Cape Gloucester
later in the year. Here was a pattern
for joint operations, and, as coastwatcher
D.C. Horton phrased it, it
was a “pattern for victory.”</p>
